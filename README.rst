The Lago Project
-----------------
Lago is an add-hoc virtual framework which helps you build virtualized
environments on your server or laptop for various use cases.

It currently utilizes 'libvirt' for creating VMs, but we are working on adding
more providers such as 'containers'.

TODO: Add the 'Lago story' and introduction.
